# <Code-Refactor>

## Description

The Horiseon home page needed refactored to add accessibility attributes in order to assure site usability to anyone using assistive technologies. Adjusting the HTML file with semantic tags and image attributes allows screen readers and other assistive tech to work smoothly over pictures on the website. With these changes the codebase follows accessibilty standards.


## Usage

The refactored version of this code is able to be used with assistive technologies. All images have alternative attributes that describe the images shown. Semantic tags are used throughout the HTML document to make the file more readable. The CSS file was also consolidated down, organized, and commented on to improve efficacy.

## Credits

Pre-existing code was taken from osu-col-virt-fsf-pt-07-2021-u-c/ repository.
